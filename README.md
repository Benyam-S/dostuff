# dostuff
dostuff is a project created for fun to encourage collaboration.

What does the 'dostuff' do? You guessed correctly it just does 'stuff'. When you use the API endpoint '/do_stuff'
it just returns 'Did stuff' in the language you are currently located (uses Geo IP location).

The translation may not be fully correct but I hope it is close enough, But if it isn't that good feel free
in changing it to the correct or closest translation. Since it is meant to encourage collaboration in a fun
way you are welcome to collaborate in whatever way seems fit.
